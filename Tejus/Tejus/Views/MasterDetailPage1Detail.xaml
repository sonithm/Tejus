        <Label FontSize="Large" Text="Have you ever witnessed your relative or close friend frantically searching for a blood donor, and blood banks say Out of stock, the donors in mind are out of reach, and time keeps ticking? Have you witnessed loss of a life only because a donor was not available at the most needed hour? Is it a situation that we as a society can do nothing to prevent? These thoughts and questions laid the foundation for TEJUS. "/>
